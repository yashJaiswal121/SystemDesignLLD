    * - Mediator can look similar to Observer and Proxy pattern.
    * - Diffrence in Mediator and Observer DP is about the intent of problem they solve.
    *   Mediator is used for loose coupling of same Type of Objects to reference or call methods on each other(Thats done via the Mediator Interface)
    *   While the Observer is used to notify the changes to all subscribed Observers when an Observable Object state is changed.
    *   And Proxy is used for Lazy Processing of client request at Proxy Layer level, also trying to do extra cross cutting concerns like Logging,Authz/Auth etc
