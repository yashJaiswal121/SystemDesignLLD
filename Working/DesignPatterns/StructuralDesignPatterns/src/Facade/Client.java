    * Usage:
    *  When you have to create a simplified interface that performs many other actions behind the scenes.
    * It is used to provide a simple interface before a complex system.
    * So that the user or client can access the simple interface without knowing the complexity of its sub-system.
    *  Facade design patterns are mostly used to hide the dependencies involved in a system from the user.
